## Introduction
The Smart Water Management System is a project aimed at maintaining water levels using a smart water tank and smart tap control system. It provides an efficient and automated solution for monitoring and controlling water flow, along with web and mobile applications for easy access and management.

## Objectives
To develop and implement an intelligent water management system that provides efficient, convenient, and sustainable control over water resources, promoting water conservation and enhancing user experience through remote monitoring, automation, and data-driven insights.

## High-level Solution Architecture

## Solution Architecture

High level diagram + description

1. **Hardware:**
   - Smart Water Tank and Smart Taps: Utilize Arduino-based hardware for monitoring water levels and controlling water flow.

2. **Web Application:**
   - Frontend: Developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - Backend: Built with Node.js and Express, providing a robust and scalable server for handling requests and business logic.
   - Database: MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage data related to water levels, water quality, and system settings.

3. **Mobile Application:**
   - Cross-platform mobile app developed using Flutter, a framework by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

4. **Version Control:**
   - The project code can be managed using Git and hosted on platforms like GitHub for collaboration and version control.

## Testing

 - Develop a testing strategy, including unit testing, integration testing, and user testing to ensure the system's reliability and functionality.
