## Introduction

The Smart Water Management System is a project aimed at maintaining water levels using a smart water tank and smart tap control system. It provides an efficient and automated solution for monitoring and controlling water flow, along with web and mobile applications for easy access and management.



## Solution Architecture

High level diagram + description

## Hardware and Software Designs

1. **Hardware:**
   - Smart Water Tank and Smart Taps: Utilize Arduino-based hardware for monitoring water levels and controlling water flow.

2. **Web Application:**
   - Frontend: Developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - Backend: Built with Node.js and Express, providing a robust and scalable server for handling requests and business logic.
   - Database: MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage data related to water levels, water quality, and system settings.

3. **Mobile Application:**
   - Cross-platform mobile app developed using Flutter, a framework by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

4. **Version Control:**
   - The project code can be managed using Git and hosted on platforms like GitHub for collaboration and version control.

## Testing

 - Develop a testing strategy, including unit testing, integration testing, and user testing to ensure the system's reliability and functionality.

## Detailed budget

All items and costs

| Item          | Quantity  | Unit Cost  | Total  |
| ------------- |:---------:|:----------:|-------:|
| Sample item   | 5         | 10 LKR     | 50 LKR |

## Conclusion

- **Smart Water Tank:**
  - Monitors water level and quality in the tank using sensors.
  - Controls water inflow and outflow using actuators.
  - Sends automatic alerts for low water level, leaks, and abnormalities.
  - Provides real-time monitoring and historical data logging.

- **Smart Tap Control System:**
  - Enables automated control of water flow through smart taps.
  - User-friendly interface for setting water flow schedules and durations.
  - Remote control and monitoring of tap activities.

- **Web Application:**
  - Accessible through a web browser.
  - Displays real-time water level, quality, and system status.
  - Allows users to control the smart taps, view usage statistics, and configure system settings.
  - Provides data visualization and analytics for effective water management.

- **Mobile Application:**
  - Cross-platform mobile app (iOS and Android) for convenient access.
  - Offers similar features as the web application, optimized for mobile devices.
  - Push notifications for critical alerts and system updates.
