# Smart Water Management System

The Smart Water Management System is a project aimed at maintaining water levels using a smart water tank and smart tap control system. It provides an efficient and automated solution for monitoring and controlling water flow, along with web and mobile applications for easy access and management.

## Features

- Smart Water Tank:
  - Monitors water level and quality in the tank using sensors.
  - Controls water inflow and outflow using actuators.
  - Sends automatic alerts for low water level, leaks, and abnormalities.
  - Provides real-time monitoring and historical data logging.

- Smart Tap Control System:
  - Enables automated control of water flow through smart taps.
  - User-friendly interface for setting water flow schedules and durations.
  - Remote control and monitoring of tap activities.

- Web Application:
  - Accessible through a web browser.
  - Displays real-time water level, quality, and system status.
  - Allows users to control the smart taps, view usage statistics, and configure system settings.
  - Provides data visualization and analytics for effective water management.

- Mobile Application:
  - Cross-platform mobile app (iOS and Android) for convenient access.
  - Offers similar features as the web application, optimized for mobile devices.
  - Push notifications for critical alerts and system updates.
